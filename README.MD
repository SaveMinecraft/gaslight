1.19.1-rc1 changed how abuse reports were sent to Mojang, context of other messages is now included. Mojang does not verify that these messages were actually sent to the server, or even that the players were on the server at the time. You can modify the request sent to Mojang to fake context around the message, messages can be signed as if they were sent in the past to make innocent messages look malicious, especially if you have keys for multiple accounts.
